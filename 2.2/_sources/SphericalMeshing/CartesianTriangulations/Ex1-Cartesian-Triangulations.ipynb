    "# Example 1 - Triangulation of arbitrary points\n",

    "`stripy` provides a python interfact to TRIPACK and SRFPACK (Renka 1997c,d) as a triangulation class that would typically be used as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",

    "triangulation = stripy.Triangulation(x=vertices_x, y=vertices_y)\n",
    "areas = triangulation.areas()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods of the `Triangulation` class include interpolation, smoothing and gradients (from SRFPACK), triangle areas, point location by simplex and nearest vertex, refinement operations by edge or centroid, and neighbourhood search / distance computations through a k-d tree algorithm suited to points on the surface of a unit sphere. `stripy` also includes template triangulated meshes with refinement operations.\n",
