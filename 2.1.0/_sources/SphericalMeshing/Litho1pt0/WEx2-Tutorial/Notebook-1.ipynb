    "In this tutorial we assume some passing familiarity making maps with the `cartopy` package and `matplotlib` within the jupyter notebook environment. We will work though how to download and manipulate the data that we need to use, but we will also need to check that we have downloaded the correct data, that we are reading it correctly and that is is not corrupted. For that there is no better check than plotting a map and taking a good look at the results.\n",
