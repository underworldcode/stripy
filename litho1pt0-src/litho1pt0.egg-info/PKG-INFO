Description: # litho1pt0 
        
        A Python interface to TRIPACK and STRIPACK Fortran code for (constrained) triangulation in Cartesian coordinates and on a sphere. Stripy is an object-oriented package and includes routines from SRFPACK and SSRFPACK for interpolation (nearest neighbor, linear and hermite cubic) and to evaluate derivatives (Renka 1996a,b and 1997a,b).
        
        `stripy` is bundled with `litho1pt0` which is a python interface to the _crust 1.0_ dataset and the lithospheric part of the _litho 1.0_ dataset (Laske et al, 2013 and Pasyanos et al, 2014) which both requires and demonstrates the triangulation / searching and interpolation on the sphere that is provided by `stripy`.
        
        
        ## Navigation / Notebooks
        
        
        There are two matching sets of `stripy` notebooks - one set for [Cartesian Triangulations](#Cartesian) and one for [Spherical Triangulations](#Spherical). For most geographical applications, the spherical triangulations are the natural choice as they expect longitude and latitude coordinates (admittedly in radians).
        
        
        Note: the Cartesian and Spherical notebooks can be obtained / installed from `stripy` itself as follows:
        
        ```bash
           python -c 'import stripy; stripy.documentation.install_documentation(path="Notebooks")'   
        ```

        ### Examples
        
        Note, these examples are the notebooks from `litho1pt0` which are installed from the
        package itself:
        
        ```bash
           python -c 'import litho1pt0; litho1pt0.documentation.install_documentation(path="Notebooks")'
        ```
        
        The first three notebooks are an introduction to `litho1pt0` that does not explicitly mention `stripy` but
        the next two worked examples show how to search, interpolate and plot with the help of `stripy` routines.

        ## Installation
        
        To install ([numpy](http://numpy.org) and fortran compiler, preferably
        [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran), required):
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py build
        ```
           - If you change the fortran compiler, you may have to add the
        flags `config_fc --fcompiler=<compiler name>` when setup.py is run
        (see docs for [numpy.distutils](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/f2py/distutils.html)).
        ```bash
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Alternatively install using pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install [--user] stripy
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Two classes are included as part of the Stripy package:
        
        - sTriangulation (Spherical coordinates)
        - Triangulation (Cartesian coordinates)
        
        These classes share similar methods and can be easily interchanged.
        In addition, there are many helper functions provided for building
        
        A series of tests are located in the *tests* subdirectory.
        
        
        ## Docker
        
        A more straightforward installation which does not depend on specific compilers relies on the [docker](http://www.docker.com) virtualisation system.
        
        To install the docker image and test it is working:
        
        ```bash
           docker pull lmoresi/stripy:0.6
           docker run --rm lmoresi/stripy:0.6 help
        ```
        
        To install the helper scripts for bash:
        
        ```bash
           docker run --rm lmoresi/stripy:0.6 bash_utils > bash_utils.sh
           source bash_utils.sh
        ```
        
        ( you may find it helpful to move/rename this file and source it from
          your bash profile at login time )
        
        The bash_utils.sh script installs the following functions which are
        available through the bash command line:
        
        ```bash
          stripy-docker-help
          stripy-docker-sh
          stripy-docker-nb
          stripy-docker-browse
          stripy-docker-serve
          stripy-docker-terminal
        ```
        
        For more information on these functions, run
        
        ```bash
          source bash_utils.sh
          stripy-docker-help
        ```
        
        To use the docker version as you would, say, using ipython to type on the command line:
        
        ```bash
           source bash_utils.sh  # (only needs to be done once)
           stripy-docker-terminal
           ls
           ipython
        ```
        
        To use the docker version to run a script
        
        ```bash
           source bash_utils.sh  # (only needs to be done once)
           stripy-docker-sh my_python_script.py
        ```
